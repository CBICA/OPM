# OPM
### Openslide patch manager: parallel reading/writing of patches.

## Installation: 
```
git clone https://github.com/grenkoca/OPM.git
cd OPM/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To try an example:
```
python mine_patches.py images/example_slide.svs output/
```
By default it detects tissue and extracts 1000 random patches from the included .svs file. Play with this number as well as the number of parallel threads in example.py (default patches=1000, default threads=100)
## Options
There are also a handful of useful options:
- `SHOW_MINED`: shows attempted patch extractions after patches are determined. Note: this does not neccesarily show *successful* patch extractions, only attempted ones. 
- `SHOW_VALID`: show where valid indices for patch extractions are. Each index is the top-left corner of the patch. 
- `READ_TYPE`: either 'sequential' or 'random'. If sequential, it repeatedly takes the top-leftmost valid index until quota is met or the slide is saturated. If random, it randomly samples a patch from the valid indices until saturated or the quota is hit.

... and various other parameters such as patch size, thumbnail/valid mask scale, and masking thresholds.

## Workflow
OPM follows the following workflow:

## Changelog
Jul. 31, 2020:
- Changed `ALLOW_OVERLAP` to `OVERLAP_FACTOR`. `OVERLAP_FACTOR` is a float from 0 to 1 that is the portion of patches that are allowed to overlap. If 0, there is no overlap allowed. If 1, they are totally allowed to overlap (except for the origin pixel).
